# Python Calculator

## Introduction
This is a Python calculator application that allows users to perform both basic and advanced arithmetic operations. The user is prompted to select an operation and enter numbers, and the result is displayed instantly.


## Objective
- Practice Python syntax and functions
- Implement basic and advanced arithmetic operations
- Learn input validation and error handling
- Create a user-friendly text-based application


## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **IDE:** VS Code / PyCharm  
- **Libraries:** Standard Python Libraries (math, input/output)


## Features
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`
- Advanced operations: `sqrt` (square root), `abs` (absolute value)
- Input validation to avoid crashes
- Division by zero handled gracefully
- Option to perform multiple calculations


## Sample Usage
Advanced Python Calculator
Available operations: +, -, *, /, %, //, **, sqrt, abs

Enter operation (e.g., +, sqrt, **): **
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 2
Result: 25.0



## How It Works
- User chooses an operation
- Inputs are collected (one or two numbers based on the operation)
- The `calculate()` function processes the request
- Result is printed
- User is asked whether they want to continue



## Challenges Faced
- Handling invalid numeric input
- Managing different operand types (unary vs binary)
- Avoiding runtime crashes (e.g., division by zero)
- Keeping code modular and clean



## Learning Outcomes
- Improved knowledge of Python functions, loops, and conditionals
- Practiced input validation and exception handling
- Built confidence with modular programming
- Learned to create and structure small CLI projects



## Future Enhancements
- Add trigonometric and logarithmic functions
- GUI version using Tkinter
- Memory/history feature
- Voice-input support
